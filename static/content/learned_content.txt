PURPOSE OF SAFETY VALVE
A safety valve serves one single purpose: to protect against unacceptable overpressure in installations or parts of 
installations which would result in the system bursting. A safety valve is a mechanical safety device that responds 
when all other control and monitoring devices fail and an impermissibly high pressure occurs in a vessel, storage 
tank, pipeline or something similar. For example, this can occur due to cooling failure, incorrect dosing or a blocked 
discharge line. If the pressure in a vessel protected by a safety valve rises above a permissible value, the valve opens 
and allows a part of the pressurised Media to escape from the vessel. As a result, the pressure drops again. When 
the pressure has dropped far enough, the safety valve closes. As a result, a safety valve does not allow the entire 
contents of a vessel to escape but only as much as is necessary to reduce the pressure back to a permissible value.

STRUCTURE / FUNCTION
A spring-loaded safety valve (Figure 1) is a mechanical component consisting of the following main components: 
seat, disc, lifting ring, spring, spindle and a pressure screw for adjusting the spring preload. These components are 
installed in a body with connections for the supply and discharge lines and a spring spring housing.

  closed state.
Figure 3: Illustration of the forces in the valve in 	
  the open state.
Via the supply line, the fluid enters the safety valve vertically from below. During normal operation, the valve plate sits 
on the valve seat and closes the opening. The force required for this is applied by the spring. It is clamped between 
an upper fixed and a lower movable valve disc. The pressure screw, which determines the position of the upper valve 
disc, can be used to adjust the contraction of the spring. This results in the pretension of the spring, and therefore the 
response pressure. The spindle guides the disc and transmits the force of the spring via the spring plate. The seat has a 
defined internal diameter, which is used to determine the maximum mass flowto which the valve can dissipate, taking 
the flow coefficient into account. 
When closed, the spring force F1 outweighs the Media force F2 (Figure 2). If the pressure in the system increases and 
therefore the force F2, the spring force F1 can no longer keep the valve completely closed above a certain pressure. A 
soft hissing sound from the valve can be heard. This is the response point of the safety valve (response point = lowest 
pressure at which the valve is audibly leaking). If the pressure continues to rise, the valve opens completely and the 
Media can flow out (Figure 3).

Figure 4: Stroke-pressure diagram describing the opening and closing behaviour of spring-loaded full-stroke or normal 	
  safety valves. 
A distinction is made between valves with different opening characteristics. The opening behaviour of a valve can 
best be illustrated in a stroke-pressure diagram (Figure 4) as a hysteresis curve. The stroke over the pressure is plot-
ted in it. The regular maximum operating pressure is approximately 85% of the valve response pressure. When the 
response pressure (1) is reached, the valve opens. First proportional to the increase in pressure, at the "pop point" 
(2) abruptly to its maximum stroke. In terms of design, this is achieved by increasing the area exposed to pressure.
The pressure acts only on the cone when the valve is closed. When the valve is open, pressure is also applied to the
stroke ring. This suddenly increases the force and the valve opens. The pressure at which the valve reaches its full
opening is the opening pressure (3) of the valve. The pressure difference between response pressure and opening
pressure is called the opening pressure difference.
If the pressure drops below the response pressure (4), the valve closes slowly at first, then abruptly again. The pres-
sure difference between the closing pressure (5) and the response pressure is referred to as the closing pressure 
difference. It is caused by the impulse current of the flowing fluid and the increase in the pressure contact area 
caused by the lifting ring of the valve. The valve must comply with certain opening and closing pressure differentials 
(according to DIN EN ISO 4126-1 and AD2000-A2) depending on the type (standard valve or full globe valve) and 
Media (compressible or incompressible):
Opening pressure difference:
•	
10% for normal and proportional safety valves (all media)
•	
5% for full stroke safety valves (all media)
Closing pressure difference: 
•	
10% for compressible media (both types)
•	
20% for non-compressible media (both types)

In the case of full stroke valves, there is an additional requirement that the proportion of the stroke up to sudden 
opening (proportional safety valves according to AD2000-A2) must not exceed 20% of the total stroke.
With the third type of valve, the proportional safety valve, the stroke of the valve increases or decreases almost 
continuously with increasing or decreasing pressure. A sudden opening without pressure increase over a range of 
more than 10% of the stroke does not occur. After tripping, these safety valves achieve the stroke required for the 
mass flow to be discharged (DIN EN ISO 4126-1 and AD2000-A2) within a maximum pressure rise of 10%.

VARIANTS
Various versions of individual valve components are available for individual valve adaptation to the conditions in the 
plant.
Lifting
There is a possibility of a version with rotary lifting or lever lifting for manual opening and lifting of the valve. 
For a rotary lift (Figure 6), turning a knurled nut on the bonnet of the valve raises the stem. This pulls the disc located on 
the spindle up with it. This creates a gap between the seat and disc and fluid can flow through the valve. Rotary lifting is 
usually used for threaded valves up to 2'' and for air and water applications.
Pulling on a lever causes the spindle and disc to lift off the seat for lever lifting (Figure 7). Lever lifting is usually used with 
flange safety valves and steam valves. For the latter, the installation of a lever lift is mandatory. 
A version without lifting device (Figure 8) is also available.
Figure 6: Rotary lifting device
Figure 7: Lever lifting device
Figure 8: without lifting device
Blocking Screw (Option A01)
If the valve in the system is to be closed and tight beyond its response pressure, for example for a pressure test, a blo-
cking screw is used. This is screwed into a threaded hole provided for this purpose in the cap of the valve from above to 
the spindle (Figure 9). This prevents the valve from opening. After the pressure test, the pressure screw must be remo-
ved again as otherwise the valve will not be able to open even in an emergency. Close the threaded hole in the cap with 
another screw (Figure 10).
Figure 10: The spindle is free and the cap is 	
    sealed gas-tight.

Stroke Sensor (Option S62)
A stroke sensor is offered for monitoring the response of a valve. This is screwed into the cap from above like the 
blocking screw (Figure 12). It strikes when the valve reaches its full stroke. This means that the control station of the 
system in which the valve is installed directly notices that the safety valve has blown off. For some series, lateral 
installation of the sensor is also possible (Figure 11).
Gas-Tight / Open
With some media it may be necessary to protect the environment from the influences of the Media even when the 
valve responds. Goetze offers valves in a gas-tight version for this purpose. However, if the Media does not pose any 
danger to the environment, an open or non-gas-tight version can be selected.

Bellows / Diaphragm
If the spring chamber must also be protected from the Media in the event of a response, the use of a bellows is 
recommended. This connects the guide plate with the disc and thus prevents the Media from entering the spring 
chamber through the spindle guide. In this way, it also prevents soiling or sticking of the sliding parts and ensures 
perfect functioning of the valve even with sticky or viscous media. In addition, the metallic bellows compensates for 
counter pressure. The response pressure of the valve remains the same regardless of whether it is an external back 
pressure or the intrinsic back pressure. In the event of a blowdown, the natural back pressure can build up at the 
outlet of the valve depending on the dimensions and design of the installed blowdown line.
An elastomer diaphragm or an elastomer bellows can prevent the Media from penetrating into the spring chamber 
instead of a metal bellows, depending on the valve type, if back pressure compensation is not required and the 
Media is neutral.

COMPARISON
There are different types of valves that perform different tasks in plants and require appropriate approvals and tests. 
•	
Safety valves are safety equipment in accordance with Directive 2014/68/EU, Pressure Equipment Directive.
As the last link in a series of safety measures, they prevent the plant component from bursting due to an imper-
missibly high pressure. They are set to the desired response pressure, marked accordingly and sealed. A later
change of the setting pressure is only possible in experienced workshops. The set pressure of all safety valves
is checked before delivery, if required also in the presence of an inspection company. A safety valve must pass
an EU type examination and, if necessary, a TÜV component test before it can be sold in series.
•	
Pressure relief valves fulfil the same function as safety valves. However, they have no safety function and are
therefore not classified as safety equipment but only as pressure equipment according to the Pressure Equip-
ment Directive. No special examination is necessary. As a rule, they have a proportional opening characteristic.
Pressure relief valves do not achieve the performance of safety valves and can be delivered adjusted, marked
and sealed, but do not have to be.
•	
The set pressure within the spring range can be adjusted by the plant operator as required in the case of overflow/
control valves. They perform a "pressure control task" in the system. As this is not a safety-relevant function, over-
flow/regulating valves are only classified as pressure-maintaining equipment according to the Pressure Equipment
Directive. No special examination is necessary. These valves have a proportional opening characteristic in order to
avoid pressure surges in the system. Overflow valves must always be gas-tight
•	
Pressure reducing valves require a component approval for building services engineering if they are used for
drinking water installations. Their task is to reduce the pressure in a part of the plant. While with pressure relief
valves the presence of an excessively high pressure on the inlet side and therefore a flow through the valve is
the exception, with pressure reducing valves a higher applied pressure on the inlet side is the rule. They are conti-
nuously flowed through and ensure a uniform fluid flow with constant, reduced pressure on the outlet side even
with fluctuating pressure on the inlet side (e.g. after a pump).

APPROVALS
In order to be allowed to sell a safety valve, it must pass an EU type examination and, if applicable, a TÜV component 
examination.
Basically, an entrance examination consists of four parts: 
1.	
The test on the sufficient dimensioning of the components as well as the suitability of the materials used.
2.	
Ensuring that the specific design requirements required by the application have been met.
3.	
The certification of the performances (discharge figures) with the media air and water.
4.	
Compliance with the functional characteristics (opening and closing pressure differences) with the media air and
water to demonstrate suitability for:	
•	
Air:
- Air, gases and technical vapours
- Steam
- Heating water (up to 120 °C)	
- Solar heating systems
•	
Water:
- Liquids
- Hot water (up to 95 °C)
These tests are described in detail in the VdTÜV data sheet "Safety Valve 100" and other applicable documents. 
EU Type Examination
An EU type examination is a type approval by an independent "notified body" according to the Pressure Equipment 
Directive 2014/68/EU. It checks whether the minimum requirements are met for a safety valve as required in Annex 1 
of the DGR and in the harmonised standard ISO 4126-1.
During a type examination, the valves can be approved for the following media:
• L	
for liquids
• S/G	
for steam/gas
The manufacturer is also obliged to supply the valve with assembly and operating instructions including a declaration of 
conformity in accordance with DGR 2014/68/EU. These inspection certificates are valid for a period of 10 years.

TÜV Component Test
In order to pass a TÜV component test, the requirements of the following standards must be met as well:
•	
VdTÜV data sheet SV 100
•	
AD2000 data sheet A2
This allows an additional application-specific marking of the valves:
•	
D/G/H	
for hot water with permissible flow temperatures up to 120 °C (heating systems according to 		
DIN EN 12828)
•	
H		
for hot water of 2.5 bar and 3 bar with a permissible flow temperature of up to 120 °C and a permissible 				
heat output of up to 2700 kW (water heating systems to DIN EN 12828)	
•	
SOL	
for closed intrinsically safe solar heating systems with water or water mixtures as heat transfer 		
Media according to DIN EN 12976-1
•	
W		
for water heating systems according to DIN EN 12897 up to 10 bar
•	
F/K/S	
for stationary pressure vessels and vehicle containers for liquid, granular and powdery goods 		
according to TRB 801 No. 22 and 23
